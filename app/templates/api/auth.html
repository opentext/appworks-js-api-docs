    AppWorksJS Authentication allows you to authenticate against your backend systems using login credentials
    stored securely on the device.
</p>

<h3>Authenticating</h3>
<p>
    Authenticate against your backend system. This is a login request made to the gateway,
    and the response may include tokens and credentials required in your app. This response
    is bound to a private object that may be accessed by using the getAuth() method.
</p>

<pre>
    <code>appworks.auth.authenticate => ()</code>
</pre>

<p>
    This method returns a promise that takes a single callback which will be executed when the auth response is returned.
    See the example below.

        </md-content>

<h3>Getting the Auth Object</h3>
<p>
    Once you have authenticated, you will want to see the response to get access to tokens and other login details.
    You can do this by calling the following method.
</p>

<pre>
    <code>appworks.auth.getAuth => ()</code>
</pre>

<p>This will return the entire response from the call against the gateway auth endpoint.</p>
